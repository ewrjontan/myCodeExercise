# My Code Exercise

## Description

This is a code exercise to build an application which does the following:

* Allows users to fetch search results from an API
* Keeps a log of a users previous search history

In this case I used the Hacker News Algolia API (https://hn.algolia.com/api)

This application was built with React.js and the following dependencies. Redux was added for state management and persistence of search history.

* "@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core": "^1.2.36"
* "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons": "^5.15.4"
* "@fortawesome/react-fontawesome": "^0.1.15"
* "bootstrap": "^5.1.0"
* "cra-template": "1.1.2"
* "react": "^17.0.2"
* "react-animation-components": "3.0.0"
* "react-dom": "^17.0.2"
* "react-popper": "^2.2.5"
* "react-redux": "7.2.0"
* "react-router-dom": "^5.2.0"
* "react-scripts": "4.0.3"
* "react-transition-group": "^4.4.2"
* "reactstrap": "^8.9.0"
* "redux": "4.0.5"
* "redux-logger": "^3.0.6"
* "redux-persist": "^6.0.0"
* "redux-thunk": "2.3.0"

## Usage

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
